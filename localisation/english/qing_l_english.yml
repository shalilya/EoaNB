 qing.1.t:0 "The Mudan Incident"
 qing.1.d:0 "The Japanese have landed in Taiwan, in an expedition in retaliation for the murder of Ryukyuan sailors by the Paiwan aborigines of South Taiwan. Their astounding success shocked us, and has revealed to the world our weak hold over Taiwan."
 qing.1.a:0 "Damn those Japanese!"
 qing.2.t:0 "A Trade of Ironclads"
 qing.2.d:0 "We have decided to buy ironclads from foreign powers in order to bolster our naval strength. However, a trade like this will be costly and unlikely to be accepted, so we must choose our trade partner wisely. With whom shall we trade?"

 qing.2.c:0 "France!"
 qing.2.h:0 "Great Britain!"
 qing.3.t:0 "An Official Flag"
 qing.3.d:0 "Your Majesty, it has lately come to our attention that a lack of a proper official flag for our nation has made our encounters with foreigners difficult. Already a few years ago, a Chinese ship the Weseners called \"HMS Arrow\", was forced to fly the British flag due to us not having any flag. This led to us capturing the ship, but due to it flying the British flag, we gave the British an excuse to attack us. In order to avoid such a misunderstanding in the future we should adopt a national flag according to Western designs. It has been proposed that our new flag will be triangular in order to avoid any confusion with the Eigth Banners rectangular flags. The flag will feature the traditional symbols of Your Majesty, the Five-clawed Dragon and the Flaming Pearl."

Accordingly, Lee began construction of his residence in 1860 under Imperial blessing, and has now finished his work this year. \n\nThe residence has been built in the traditional Hakka style, consisting of two main rooms and four side buildings, guarded by a semi-circular pool and a whitewashed wall of mud brick.

Many reformers have proposed to protect china's culture and tradition at the cost of adapting to a westernized military and industry for the survival of the empire. As Wei Yuan once said, 'what we have to learn from the barbarians is only the one thing - solid ships and effective guns'.

Instead of issuing an execution for Zeng like many officials have expected, he was promoted by Xianfeng due to his honesty and was authorized to form his own Army to help fight the Taiping rebels.

The First Opium War was served as a wake-up call to the empire and its officials that the empire was not invincible, at the same t ime prompting them that their empire will not last any longer if they refuse to adapt to technological changes. Recently the British engaged with our forces around canton in 1856, starting the Second Opium War. Although the Second Opium War has officially begun, the British are still preoccupied with the Sepoy Rebellion in India which raises the question as to whether the Qing will ignore the consequences of the british invasion on China or take measures to prepare for the inevitable invasion, which will shape the fate of the nation. "

The Imperial Examination papers were then subjected to reviewing by the Officials, which exposed his weakeness in both art and science. Upon reporting by Mo Kan to Meng Chuangjin, Meng immediately reported the situation to  Xianfeng due to his loyalty to the Emperor and incorruptibility. /n This has been one of the few times a bribery has occured in the Imperial Examination, with the first one under the Shunzhi Emperor and the other under Kangxi Emperor.
